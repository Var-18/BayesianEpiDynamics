# BayesianEpiDynamics
## Description:

This repository hosts the STAD94 course project led by Varun V. Datta under the supervision of Dr. Kenneth Butler at the University of Toronto Scarborough in 2024. The project aims to perform a Comparative Bayesian Analysis of Epidemiological Data during disease outbreaks. Utilizing real outbreak data, we leverage the power of R and Stan to implement Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. This analysis is further enriched by an extensive literature review, guiding our understanding and methodologies in epidemiological modeling.
